# Coral

A PyTorch-based neural network library for board game evaluation.

## Overview

Coral provides a flexible framework for building and deploying neural networks to evaluate board game positions. It includes modular components for input conversion, neural network architectures, and output interpretation.

## Features

- **Multiple NN Architectures**: Multi-layer perceptrons, transformers, and custom models
- **Flexible Input/Output Conversion**: Modular converters for different board representations and evaluation formats
- **Point-of-View Evaluation**: Support for evaluating positions from different player perspectives
- **PyTorch Integration**: Built on PyTorch with JIT compilation support for optimized inference

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/victorgabillon/coral.git@main
```

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.13
- PyTorch
- valanga (board game library)
